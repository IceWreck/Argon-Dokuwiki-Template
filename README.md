# Argon Dokuwiki Template

## Sidebar

If you have a sidebar, then links in bullet points will have consistent styling with the rest of the template.

## Styling

I've imported the base stylesheet from the argon design system and then added custom styles on top in the ___assets/css/doku.scss___ file. The file is then compiled to CSS using SASS.

To do changes and have it compile live, do
```
sass --watch assets/css/doku.scss assets/css/doku.css
```
